Access Zehnder data via CAN interface

## What?
This small module and app was written to interact with a Zehnder ComfoQ system via the CAN bus. It uses the socketcan interface to send and receive packets via the CAN bus. If your CAN module does not use the socketcan interface this module isn't for you.

## Why?
As part of our Zehnder installation we have a ComfoConnect LAN-C module which allows access via our home network. This works well and we use the Zehnder app to control the unit. However, we also use HomeAssistant to monitor the unit - also via the network. As only one device can be connected via the network at once, this leads to times when we loose monitoring or have difficulty in using the app. By using the second CAN interface on the LAN-C unit we should be able to retrieve the monitoring data without using the network connection. 

## Sample Output
The sample application produces a simple dump of PDO's seen on the CAN interface.

```
$ ./zcan -interface can0
